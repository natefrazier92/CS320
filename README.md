How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Thoroughly testing any code, program, or software helps ensure its functionality and security. Testing frequently and early enables you to identify code issues sooner, allowing for quicker corrections or enhancements. Ensuring that the code operates as intended and can manage edge cases makes the software more secure and reduces the likelihood of failure.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Understanding user needs is paramount to the success of any software project. Through techniques like direct observation, I gather deep insights into user expectations and behaviors. Prototyping is a critical step in this process, allowing for iterative feedback that directly shapes the development process. This approach ensures that the final product aligns closely with user requirements and expectations.

How do I approach designing software?

My approach to designing software starts with gathering and understanding the requirements. From there, depending on the number of requirements, I break it down into smaller, related, groups of tasks. Then I get to work writing the code. It is best to be sure to create unit tests as youâ€™re going to make sure the parts of the program are working as expected.
